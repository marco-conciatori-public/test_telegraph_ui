The "INT" Cable (Interrupt)
The INT (Interrupt) cable is a crucial efficiency tool. Without it, your Raspberry Pi 5 has to constantly ask the button controller, "Is a button pressed?
Is a button pressed?" (Polling). This wastes CPU cycles and saturates the I2C bus.

With the INT line connected to a GPIO pin on the Pi:
The button controller stays silent until a button is actually pressed.
When a press occurs, the controller pulls the INT line LOW (active low).
Your Pi detects this voltage drop on its GPIO pin and only then executes the I2C read command to see which button it was.

The C Program
Assumption: I have written this for a generic I/O expander (like the PCF8574, which is very common for button arrays) on the standard address 0x27.
If you are using an MCP23017, you simply need to write the register address before reading (I added a comment in the code for this).

A Note on the "INT" Implementation
In the code above, I used a polling method (usleep) inside a while(1) loop. This is the easiest way to get started and verify your connections.

Since you are dealing with robotics and AGI where latency matters, eventually you will want to implement the true Interrupt method. To do that in C on the
 Raspberry Pi 5 (which uses the new GPIO chip architecture), you would need the libgpiod library.

The logic flow would change from:
Sleep 50ms
Read I2C
Repeat

To:
Monitor GPIO Pin X (connected to INT)
Block (pause execution) until Pin X goes LOW.
Wake up -> Read I2C immediately.
