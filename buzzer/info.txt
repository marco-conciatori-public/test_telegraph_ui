I have interpreted the "Clock" signal as the frequency source (the tone generator) and the 4-bit interface as
 a parallel volume control (0-15).

Notes for Setup
Wiring:

I defined the Clock on GPIO 18 (Pin 12 on the physical header), which is a hardware PWM pin on the Pi, though pigpio
can handle PWM on any pin.

The Volume Bits are on GPIOs 23, 24, 25, 8.

Ensure the GND of the buzzer module is connected to a Pi GND pin.

Ensure the 5V of the buzzer is connected to a Pi 5V pin.

Compiling & Running: Since pigpio interacts directly with the hardware registers, you must link the pthread and rt
libraries and run the executable with sudo.

Bash

gcc -o buzzer buzzer_control.c -lpigpio -lrt -lpthread
sudo ./buzzer

Clock Signal: I implemented the "Clock" signal as a 50% duty cycle square wave (PWM). The frequency of this
square wave determines the pitch of the sound, while your 4-bit interface controls the amplitude (loudness).

Let me know if the "Clock" pin on your specific module functions differently (e.g., if it's a latch clock for a
shift register instead of the audio source), and I can adjust the driver logic!
